# GCSRM Quest Task
This is my submission for the quest task.  
It includes:
- Responsive Navbar
- Hero section with grid layout
- Carousel with transitions
- Product grid
- Footer
  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 

tried my best :)                                            
I did finish it in less than 4 hours after the "quest" was open , i doubt anybody else did it faster
Hope to be part of the club!
